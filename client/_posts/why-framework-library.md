title: Do we need a Frontend Framework or Library?
---

While developing a Web Application, many people wonder, **"Do I need a Front-End Framework or Library?"** while starting up.

While using Front-End Frameworks and Libraries would definitely simplify your task, there's more to this than meets the eye. Developing Web Applications with Vanilla JS and simplistic HTML & CSS would require you to make extensive use of DOM to get JSON Data and append it to the HTML Elements.

This approach works while you are prototyping but later your JS and CSS would fatten up, bringing down the Performance, while making simple changes and bug fixes would require extensive development. Storing your Data in the DOM and making sense of the code would be too much of an issue.

Here comes in a Front-End Framework or Library: Breaking down your Code into Components will make them reusable and maintains your User-Interface. You can structure your Data Flow in the Application with them and use of Preprocessors and Transpilers easily.

It will also help you follow a Design Architecture that would help you while you are scaling. It brings the Speed and Maintenance in your Application. So if you are looking for all these features, what wait for? Get started with Front-End Development with plenty of frameworks around.
