title:  "Why React?"
---

While starting up with any Front-End Library or Framework to develop Web Applications, the most common option, 
you would get is to get started with "React".

But there is more to the React Ecosystem than meets the eye. In the React Ecosystem, you would find various Systems 
like `Create-React-App`, `Next` and `Gatsby` to build your React Applications without bundling the App via a Webpack.

So what exact difference the three make? Create React App is the standard CLI Tool employed by Facebook to set up a React 
application in seconds. It employs JSX, a combination of HTML and injected JS and supports Client-Side Rendering. This makes 
your Website non-responsive to Search Engine Optimization.

Next is a development over React and employs Server-Side Rendering which allows you to make SEO Optimizations and also manages 
to support CSS in JSX in form of "Styled-JSX".

Lastly, we have got Gatsby, which makes Lightning Fast Static Websites. The best part about Gatsby is the rise in the ecosystem 
for Gatsby Plugins. This makes it a competitor for traditional Content Management System like WordPress in the near future.
